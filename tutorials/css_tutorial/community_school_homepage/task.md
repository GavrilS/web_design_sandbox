# Style the text for a community school homepage

* Fonts:
    - a serif site-wide font for the general body
    - sans-serif or slab serif for the headings

* General text styling:
    - Give the page a site-wide font-size of 10px.
    - Give your headings and other element types appropriate font-sizes defined using a suitable relative unit.
    - Give your body text a suitable line-height.
    - Center your top level heading on the page.
    - Give your headings a little bit of letter-spacing to make them not too squashed, and allow the letters to breathe a bit.
    - Give your body text some letter-spacing and word-spacing, as appropriate.
    - Give the first paragraph after each heading in the <section> a little bit of text-indentation, say 20px.

* Links:
    - Give the link, visited, focus, and hover states some colors that go with the color of the horizontal bars at the top and bottom of the page.
    - Make it so that links are underlined by default, but when you hover or focus them the underline disappears.
    - Remove the default focus outline from ALL the links on the page.
    - Give the active state a noticeably different styling so it stands out nicely, but make it still fit in with the overall page design.
    - Make it so that external links have the external link icon inserted next to them.

* Lists:
    - Make sure the spacing of your lists and list items works well with the styling of the overall page. Each list item should have the same line-height as a paragraph line, and each list should have the same spacing at its top and bottom as you have between paragraphs.
    - Give your list items a nice bullet appropriate for the design of the page. It is up to you whether you choose a custom bullet image or something else.

* Navigation menu:
    - Style your navigation menu so that it harmonizes with the page.
