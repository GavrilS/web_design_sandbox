Task source: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics/Fancy_letterheaded_paper

Instructions:
- Apply the CSS to the HTML.

- Add a background declaration to the letter that:
    - Fixes the top image to the top of the letter
    - Fixes the bottom image to the bottom of the letter
    - Adds a semi-transparent gradient over the top of both of the previous backgrounds that gives the letter a bit of texture. Make it slightly dark right near the top and bottom, but completely transparent for a large part of the center.

- Add another background declaration that just adds the top image to the top of the letter, as a fallback for browsers that don't support the previous declaration.

- Add a white background color to the letter.

- Add a 1mm top and bottom solid border to the letter, in a color that is in keeping with the rest of the color scheme.
