# Task 2 details:
In this task, we want you to add background images, a border, and some other styling to a decorative box:

1. Give the box a 5px lightblue border and round the top left corner 20px and the bottom right corner 40px.
2. The heading uses the star.png image as a background image, with a single centered star on the left and a repeating pattern of stars on the right. You can use the following image:

3. Make sure that the heading text does not overlay the image, and that it is centered â€” you will need to use techniques learned in previous lessons to achieve this.
