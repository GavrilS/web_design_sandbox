Re: Eileen Dover university application

Dear Eileen,

Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part of your PhD next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.

Starting dates

We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:

First semester: 9 September 2016
Second semester: 15 January 2017
Third semester: 2 May 2017

Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.

You can find more information about important university dates on our website.


Subjects of study

At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility ‚Äî as long as the subjects fall somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued by are as follows, in order of priority:

Turning H2O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C14H12O3.)
Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30¬∞C (86¬∞F), when the audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 √ó 103 increasing to 3 √ó 104.)
HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.

So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.


Exotic dance moves

Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question, my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:

Polynesian chicken dance
A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village would dance around in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful".
Icelandic brownian shuffle
Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired modern styles such as Twerking.
Arctic robot dance
An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have discovered a new dance style characterized by "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this because they were really cold.

For more of my research, see my exotic dance research page.

Yours sincerely,
Dr Eleanor Gaye

To expose metrics from a Python application to Prometheus, you typically use the `prometheus_client` library, which provides an easy way to define and send custom metrics. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to set this up.
Step 1: Install the Prometheus Client Library

You can install the `prometheus_client` library using pip:
pip install prometheus_client
Step 2: Write Your Python Application

Here is a simple example of a Python application that exposes some basic metrics:
from prometheus_client import start_http_server, Summary, Counter
import random
import time

# Create metric variables 
REQUEST_TIME = Summary('request_processing_seconds', 'Time spent processing request')
REQUEST_COUNT = Counter('my_app_requests_total', 'Total number of requests')

# Decorator to measure the time spent on processing requests
@REQUEST_TIME.time()
def process_request():
    """A dummy function that simulates request processing."""
    time.sleep(random.uniform(0.1, 0.5))  # Simulate variable processing time

def main():
    # Start up the server to expose the metrics.
    start_http_server(8000)  # This will start serving at http://localhost:8000/metrics
    
    while True:
        REQUEST_COUNT.inc()  # Increment the counter by one for each request.
        process_request()   # Process a request.

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
Step 3: Run Your Application

You can run your Python application by saving it as `app.py` and executing it:
python app.py
This will start an HTTP server on port `8000`, exposing your metrics at `http://localhost:8000/metrics`.
Step 4: Configure Prometheus to Scrape Metrics

Next, you'll need to configure your Prometheus server so it knows where to scrape these new metrics from. Edit your Prometheus configuration file (usually named `prometheus.yml`) and add your application's endpoint under `scrape_configs` like so:
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'my_python_app'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:8000']  
Make sure you have installed and set up Prometheus correctly according to its documentation.
Step 5: Start or Restart Your Prometheus Server

After modifying the configuration file, restart or start your Prometheus server so that it picks
 Ask original GPT-4o Mini
can you show an example with a Gauge metric type as well and include labels in the metric please
GPT-4o Mini
Certainly! Here's an example of a Python application that uses the `prometheus_client` library to expose metrics, including a `Gauge` metric type with labels. We will modify the previous example to include a `Gauge` for tracking current active users.
Step 1: Install the Prometheus Client Library

If you haven't installed it yet, ensure you have the `prometheus_client` library installed:
pip install prometheus_client
Step 2: Write Your Python Application

Here‚Äôs an updated version of our application that includes a Gauge metric with labels:
from prometheus_client import start_http_server, Summary, Counter, Gauge
import random
import time

# Create metric variables 
REQUEST_TIME = Summary('request_processing_seconds', 'Time spent processing request')
REQUEST_COUNT = Counter('my_app_requests_total', 'Total number of requests')
ACTIVE_USERS = Gauge('my_app_active_users', 'Current active users', ['status'])

# Decorator to measure time spent on processing requests
@REQUEST_TIME.time()
def process_request():
    """A dummy function that simulates request processing."""
    time.sleep(random.uniform(0.1, 0.5))  # Simulate variable processing time

def main():
    # Start up the server to expose metrics.
    start_http_server(8000)  # This will start serving at http://localhost:8000/metrics
    
    while True:
        # Increment total request count.
        REQUEST_COUNT.inc()

        # Simulate changing number of active users.
        num_active_users = random.randint(1, 10)
        
        # Set gauge values for active users based on status (simulated as "online" or "offline").
        ACTIVE_USERS.labels(status='online').set(num_active_users)
        
        inactive_users = 10 - num_active_users 
        ACTIVE_USERS.labels(status='offline').set(inactive_users)

        process_request()  # Process a request.

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
Explanation:


Gauge Metric: In this example, we define a Gauge called ACTIVE_USERS, which has one label called status. This gauge tracks how many users are currently "online" and how many are "offline".

Labels: The labels allow you to categorize your metrics. For instance:

When setting the gauge value for online users (ACTIVE_USERS.labels(status='online')) we set it dynamically based on randomly generated values.

Similarly for offline users.




Step 3: Run Your Application

Save this code in a file named `app.py` and run it as follows:
python app.py
This starts an HTTP server on port `8000`, exposing your metrics at URL http://localhost:8000/metrics.
Step 4: Configure Prometheus to Scrape Metrics

As described previously, add your application's endpoint under the scrape configuration in Prometheus' configuration file (`prometheus.yml`) like so:
scrape_configs:
 - job_name: 'my_python_app'
   static_configs:
     - targets: ['localhost:8000'] 
Step 5: Start or Restart Your Prometheus Server

After modifying your configuration file, restart or start your Prometheus server so that it picks up these new settings. You can then access the Prometheus UI and check if it's scraping data from your application properly.
Now you've successfully created a Python application exposing both simple counter and gauge metrics with labels!
